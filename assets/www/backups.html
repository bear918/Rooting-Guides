	      <b>Titanium Backup</b><br>
	      Titanium Backup is an application that allows you to backup all of your apps,<br>
	      both on internal memory and your SD card,
	      plus user data for those apps.<br><br>
	  
	      It is free, and you can get it in the market.<br> 
	      There is, however, a paid version that allows you to do a little more.<br> 
	      The app requires BusyBox, so search the market for that and install
	      it for your device.<br>
		  Then you are ready to open the app.<br><br>
	  
	      <img src="images/backup_1.png" alt="backup"><br><br>
	      There are three tabs on the top,<br> 
	      but the one you will use the most is probably Backup/Restore.<br> 
	      You will see all of your apps listed.<br><br><br>
		  
	      <img src="images/backup_2.png" alt="backup"><br>
          
		  <b>Schedule backups</b><br>
	      In the schedules tab you can also set times when you would like to do backups.<br><br>  

	      <img src="images/backup_3.png" alt="backup"><br>

		  You can choose one by one the apps to backup or by tapping Menu>Batch you 
	      can see a list of commands to do a bunch at a time.<br><br>
		  
	      <img src="images/backup_4.png" alt="backup"><br>
	      All of the backups are stored on your SD Card,<br> 
	      so it is fairly simple to get them off.<br> 
	      Just mount you SD Card and drag the titanuim backup folder to your desktop.<br>
	      The premium version features better support and more batch operations.<br>
	      It can be purchased for 5.99 USD.<br>
