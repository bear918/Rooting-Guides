	Custom ROM's

	  A <b>stock ROM</b> is the version of the phone's 
	  operating system that comes with your phone when you buy it.<br><br>
	  
      A <b>custom ROM</b> is a fully standalone version of the OS,<br>
	  including the kernel (which makes everything run),<br>
	  apps, services, etc - everything you need to operate the device,<br>
	  except it's customized by someone in some way.<br><br>
      
	  So what does the <b>"customized"</b> part mean? Since Android is open source,<br>
	  developers are free to take stock ROMs,<br>
	  modify them, strip them of garbage,<br>
	  optimize them, add things, and pretty much do
	  whatever their imagination and skills allow.<br><br>

     The word <b>ROM</b> means <b>R</b>ead <b>O</b>nly <b>M</b>emory,<br>
	 but has migrated in the modding community
	 to mean an actual custom OS image that you
	 install into the ROM area of your phone.<br><br>
        Also, the word <b>kernel</b> essentially means the heart of the OS,<br>
		it's the barebone of the operating system.<br>

	 <b>Why you want custom ROM's</b><br><br>
      Using a custom ROM usually results in more
	  frequent updates that fix bugs and introduce new
	  features because the developer behind the ROM doesn't
	  have the same procedures to follow
	  that the manufacturer and carriers does.<br><br>
	  
      A quality update can be churned faster because,<br>
      it doesn't involve the bureaucracy of
      30 different project managers, 15 vice presidents,<br>
      and 5 dozen marketing departments.<br>
      A ROM developer usually gains a loyal
	  community which beta tests his updates in
	  real life situations and provide feedback,<br>
	  or even fixes bugs that's the beauty of open source software.<br><br>
	  
      Oh and did I mention that ROMs are usually free<br>
	  and supported by optional donations? If you can't afford to pay for it,<br>
	  you don't have to.
      Finally, most custom ROMs out there are updateable<br>
	  over the air (OTA) and without reinstalling anything.<br>
      Who doesn't love open source after this?<br>
