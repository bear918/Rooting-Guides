	  Rooting your Android phone
	  is a term that you are bound to come
	  across at some point or another
	  while learning how to optimize your
	  Android device.<br>
	  With millions of new Android owners 
	  cropping up each month,
	  we decided to give a basic introduction
	  into the world of rooting
	  and to let you decide if it's something
	  you'd like to do.

	  Rooting is the process by which
	  you regain administrative access to 
	  your phone.<br>
	  Even though Android is opensource,
	  you still don't have full "root access"
	  to do what you please on your phone.<br>
	  Back when the iPhone launched in 2007,
	  the hardcore techies quickly realized
	  the true
	  potential of the device and the cruel
	  software limitations that
	  Apple had sealed it with.<br>
	  What became 'jailbreaking' on the iPhone was
	  quickly translated to other platforms as well,
	  and when the world saw the first Android back
	  in 2008, the term "rooting" was born

	  After having rooted your device,
	  you can also use Wi-Fi or Bluetooth tethering to share your cellular data connection with your laptop, PC, or other capable
	  mobile devices.<br> 
	  The application works with ad hoc connections and
	  will get you up and running online on your laptop in no time.<br>
	  Similarly, tethering can also be achieved over a Bluetooth connection.<br>

	  <b>Hardware/Software Interaction</b><br>
      Most Android devices come with hardware that is fairly heavily capable,
	  yet the OS limits them and becomes the bottleneck.<br>
	  By rooting, you actually remove the bottleneck and
	  hence can take full advantage of your beloved Android.<br> 
      For example, overclocking a device's CPU is fairly simple and rather safe thanks to many<br> 
      third-party apps,<br> 
	  yet the OS does not allow it natively,
	  and hence overclocking can only be done with a rooted phone.<br>
      Or suppose you want to use your mobile's LED as flashlight (HTC Desire, anyone?)<br>
	  but cannot because HTC won't allow it?<br>
	  Rooting will allow you to bypass this limitation!<br>
